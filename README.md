# Flappy-Bird-game
This Python code is a simplified Flappy Bird game implemented using the Pygame library. It features a bird that the player can control by pressing the spacebar to avoid pipes. The game keeps track of the player's score and handles collisions. It's ready for pushing to GitHub for sharing and collaboration.
